# Core concepts

## Tile

Tiles are standalone pieces of user interface that are handled by a HTTP server, possibly supporting authenticated interactions from clients.

### Content

Tiles content is made of elements using the following 3 primitive components:

- `Box`: a container for other components, possibly with a specific style.
- `Text`: an element that displays a string of text or other `Text` elements, possibly with a specific style.
- `Image`: an element that displays an image.

### Interactions

In addition to static contents, tiles can contain interactions based on a single text or choices input and one or multiple buttons.

Tiles interactions are signed using a DID managed by the client, ensuring all user interactions are authenticated without providing additional frictions for end-users.

### Metadata

Additional metadata such as a title and description can be attached to tiles to help discovery and static display, in addition to a protocol version to ensure compatibility between tile handlers and clients.
